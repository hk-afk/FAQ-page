        <div class="question">1. What is an FAQ page?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          An FAQ (frequently asked questions) page answers the most common
          questions customers and other website visitors have. It provides
          information related to products and policies, allowing people to
          source answers independently, without support.

        <div class="question">2. Why do you need an FAQ page?</div>
        <div class="answer">
          Many customers find your website through search engines. A
          comprehensive FAQ page is a powerful way to capture organic search
          traffic. Well-written FAQ answers can appear as featured snippets on
          Google Search results pages.
